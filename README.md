### POCS - InDepth
USB Backdoor (fanny/stuxnet/brutalkangaroo inspired)
I will (as a `first`) try - make maybe a `.bat` or `powershell`, or maybe `.C` script/source, to(broadly speaking):
  - Scan For Currently avail.Storages (disk/drives/media/Removables,...,etc)
  - Choose a specific type of storage (say, Removable USB, optionally, perhaps, 'only a specific brand/vendor/version(..)') <- __ill explain why in a moment.__
